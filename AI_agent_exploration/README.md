# AI Agent Exploration

This folder is for learning and experimenting with AI agent ideas.

I use this space to:
- try small examples
- test new ideas
- take notes while learning
- experiment without worrying about breaking anything

## What’s inside
- Simple code experiments
- Notes and examples related to AI / agents
- Learning exercises and drafts

## Purpose
This is a **learning folder**, not production code.
Things here may be unfinished or change often.

## Notes
Anything stable or important can be moved to another folder later.
