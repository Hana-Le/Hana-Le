### Hi there, welcome to my page ðŸ‘‹ :wave: :wave:
I recently graduated from Macquarie University with a degree in Applied Statistics and have a passion for data analytics. I'm interested in Statistical modelling, Data visalisation and Deep learning.
I love to create things that make a difference, and I'm always on the lookout for new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow. Check out my projects to see what I've been up to!

Feel free to reach out to me if you want to connect or collaborate ðŸ˜„
